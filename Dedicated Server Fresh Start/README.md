# | **Dedicated Server: Fresh Start**

This part of the Project will focus on preparing your dedicated Server/VDS for L4D2.  
For this you will need to make use of an SSH Client such as [Putty](http://www.putty.org/).

> **L4D2 Prerequisites:**  
> Simply enter these commands into your Terminal after connecting and logging in to your Dedicated Server with your SSH Client.

**dpkg --add-architecture i386 # enable multi-arch  
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install gcc gdb lib32gcc1  
apt install libc6:i386 # install base 32bit libraries  
apt install lib32ncurses5 lib32z1
apt install gdb # For debug srcds**

> **Creating a User to run the Servers on**  
> You don't want to be running these services on root, do you?!  
> We'll call the account Steam and allow it to run certain Root commands so that you won't have to log into Root all the time.  
> After that, we'll login to the user. (login will ask you which user to log in to, simply log in to your new user)

**adduser steam**  
**adduser steam sudo**  
**login**

> **Installing Steam and L4D2 Files**  
> We're no longer logged in to our Root user, we'll be logged in to our user "Steam".  
> By entering these commands in order you'll have your files installed in "**/home/steam/Steam/steamapps/common/l4d2**"

**wget http://media.steampowered.com/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz  
tar -xvzf steamcmd_linux.tar.gz  
./steamcmd.sh  
login anonymous  
force_install_dir ./Steam/steamapps/common/l4d2  
app_update 222860 validate  
quit**

> **Setup the Server Start/Restart/Stop Files**  
> Now we'll be using the srcds1 file provided with the README.  
> I recommend having [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.1.html) in order to make this as smooth as possible.

The srcds1 file provided has all the information you need inside it.  
After setting up your server cfgs and properly editing the srcds files, put them into your **/etc/init.d** folder.
To do this you will need to use of an FTP Client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).  
Simply login to your root user as you would through SSH, I recommend using SFTP. (Port 23)

> **Starting, Restarting or Stopping your Servers**  
> First we'll have to allow the system to actually run the files, which we'll do by entering the following command(s) into the Terminal, run the command for every srcds file you have placed into the folder.

**sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/srcds1**

> **All set!**  
>Now you can simply Start/Restart/Stop servers individually with simple commands.  
>Start your command with the file location and then the action.

Example: **/etc/init.d/srcds1 restart**
