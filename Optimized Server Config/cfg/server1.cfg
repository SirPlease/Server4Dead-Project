// Made easy to work with both "Vanilla" and Competitive Servers
// Requires little to no knowledge, everything is explained.

// [General]

                                         // (Forcing the IP as a non-group member in lobby, or directly connecting always works)

// [Other Neat Stuff]
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
sv_allow_lobby_connect_only "0"          // If set to 1, players may only join this server from matchmaking lobby, may not connect directly.

// [File Consistency]     
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 
sv_consistency "1"                       // Whether the server enforces file consistency for critical files.
sv_pure "2"                              // The server will force all client files to come from Steam and additional files matching the Server.
sv_pure_kick_clients "1"                 // If set to 1, the server will kick clients with mismatching files.

// [Addon Disabler]     
// - This Setting will disable/enable the Serverside Addon Disabler.
// - Setting it to 1 will activate the Disabler whilst still allowing you to allow certain players to enter with addons (in Competitive Configs this is used to allow spectators registered as casters to use addons)
// - Setting it to 0 will disable the Disabler.
